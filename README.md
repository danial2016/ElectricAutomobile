My robot project is just beginning to see the dawn of light. This repo will contain all the software needed for driving and controlling it robot. I will try to add extensive documentation of what each software module does and how they interact on the bigger scale. Some description will be included of hardware specifications as well. There will be modules for driving DC-motors, implementing a PID-controller, sensor control, Wifi and server communication and so on. The main language will be C.
